<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hi Marcie,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How are you doing? How is life?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I got your email from Tao. I hope you remember, I worked for Grand Central 
in 2005. I was a contractor there. I hear you have been working for Minor Ventures now so I figured may be 
I could discuss it with you. I have been working on an app for more than 8 
months now and just released is to a very small audience - friends and 
ex-colleagues. Its a kind of pre-beta and still a lot of work needs to be done. 
I have some good features in mind which needs dedicated time and some serious 
testing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I built a basic web site here:
<a href="http://symbeeonline.com/">http://symbeeonline.com/</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a nutshell - this is what the app is about:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symbee eliminates the need for you to ever send 
a file to anybody, ever upload the file to any server or website, ever email or 
ftp the file. Just share the files and let your buddies pick up the files they 
like and when they like. You do the same. Don't ask your buddies to send files, 
just browse and search the shared folders and pick up the files you like. Browse 
through the photos shared by your buddies as if they were on your machine, 
preview each photo and choose what to save and what to skip.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the better features of the app are:</font></p>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Share Folders</u>
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/shareview_sshot.JPG">
[Screen Shot]</a><br>
Share your folders with your Google Talk IM Buddies. Login with your Google Talk 
account and start sharing folders with you Google Talk buddies. Once you share 
folders, you buddies will be able to instantly browse through your shared 
folders.<br>
&nbsp; </font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Browse Shared folders</u>
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/shareview_sshot.JPG">

You can instantly browse folders that your buddies have shared<br>
&nbsp; </font></li>
<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Search</u>
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/search_sshot.JPG">

Search the folders that you buddies have shared. If your buddies are using Google 
desktop, Symbee uses Google desktop to provide the search results<br>

<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/thumb_nail_sshot.JPG">

<li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Download Directories/Multiple Files</u>
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/directory_download_sshot.JPG">
[Screen Shot]</a><br>
You can select multiple files or whole directories to be copied</font></li>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right now, I am doing all the development and 
testing work. A college student back in India helped me to build the website. I 
have been working on it quite some time now and have put in a lot of efforts to 
have the first basic version up. I wanted to build a working version before I 
can discuss it with anybody for fund raising or any other kind of help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Would you or somebody whom you know be 
interested to take a deeper look at the Application. Let me know if you are 
interested, I just thought of bringing it your notice, I can provide you with 
more details if you like.</font></p>
