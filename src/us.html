<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symbee eliminates
the need for you to ever send a file to anybody, every upload the file to any 
server or website, ever email or ftp the file. Just share the files and let your 
buddies pick up the files they like and when they like. You do the same. Don't 
ask you buddies to send files, just browse and search the shared folders and 
pick up the files you like. Browse through the photos shared by your buddies as 
if they were on your machine, preview each photo and choose what to save and 
what to skip.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symbee is a free Peer to Peer folder sharing 
tool. There are numerous other free tools supporting file sharing. However most 
of the tools are either anonymous file sharing tools where you don't know who is 
sharing the files or are push based i.e. you have to call or message your friend to 
send a file and wait for him to respond. Symbee aims to bring folder sharing to 
desktops across the Internet in a way that was otherwise only available on 
intranet with the help of expensive shared file system hardware and software. In 
a nutshell Symbee is like Windows Shared Folders across the Internet. Symbee 
supports sharing of folders with your Google Talk buddies instantly allowing you 
to browse, download, search, preview the files that your buddies have shared.</font></p>
