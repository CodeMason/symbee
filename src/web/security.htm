<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We believe in Security as much as we believe in 
file sharing. We are focused on providing a secure application as much as we are 
focused on building killer features in our applications. We believe security in 
an integral part of any application and work hard toward making Symbee a secure 
application.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symbee is developed in Java and deployed and 
  executed using the Java Web Start. This makes it very difficult to be infected 
  with virus.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">All communication between the Symbee client 
  and the Symbee server are done over Secured Socket Layer (SSL).<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your Google talk password is encrypted before it is sent over the SSL 
  Socket. The Google Talk account password is never sent to your buddies or used 
  for any communication. Symbee server 
  does not store or log Google Talk password or your buddy list, it only uses it to validate your 
  identity and disposes it immediately.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Only buddies that are already listed in your 
  Google Talk buddy list can access your shared folders.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">All communication between you and your 
  buddies is encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms. Even with access 
  to your network (System Administrators), intruders wont be able to access the 
  files 
  that flows between you and your buddy.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buddies can browse only shared folders. They 
  cannot download a file that is not in the shared folder even if they know the 
  path of the file on your computer.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can block specific buddies from 
  accessing your shared folders. You can also setup Symbee to allow only 
  specific buddies to access your shared folders.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can block users for being able to Search 
  your shared folders.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can block certain file types from being 
  shared, such files don't get listed or can be downloaded even when you share 
  the folders where they are located.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Symbee does not support sharing of hidden 
  folders or files and root directories. Hidden folders or files in shared folders don't get listed 
  nor can be downloaded. This is built in to the application and cannot be 
  turned off even if the user desires to do so.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">You shared folders are specific to the 
  computer that you use and user you login to your computer. </font></li>
