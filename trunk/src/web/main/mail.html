<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Subject: Try this app - Share, browse, search - 
Never email, attach, upload, ftp......</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Folks, </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We spend a lot of time uploading/downloading 
photos, music and various other file types and more often than not waiting for 
your buddy to upload it or send it to you. I have been working on this tool for 
quite some time now and handpicked a few folks (about 40) to release the first 
beta out. Its a peer to peer folder sharing tool, but unlike other tools, it is 
more about sharing the folders with your buddies (Google Talk only as of now). 
You can browse folders, photos (preview thumbnails), search files that your 
buddies share at a speed as if they were&nbsp; on your computer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I named the tool Symbee - derived from the word 
Symbiotic i.e. to collaborate - an attribute of a peer-to-peer application.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">the basic philosophy is to eliminate the need for you to ever send a file to anybody, ever upload the file to any 
server or website, ever email or ftp the file. Just share the files and let your 
buddies pick up the files they like and when they like. You do the same. Don't 
ask your buddies to send files, just browse and search the shared folders and 
pick up the files you like. Browse through the photos shared by your buddies as 
if they were on your machine, preview each photo and choose what to save and 
what to skip.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the better features of the app are:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Share Folders</u> </font>
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">
  <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/shareview_sshot.JPG">[Screen Shot]</a></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  Share your folders with your Google Talk IM Buddies. Login with your Google 
  Talk account and start sharing folders with you Google Talk buddies. Once you 
  share folders, your buddies will be able to instantly browse through your 
  shared folders.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Search</u> </font>
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">
  <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/search_sshot.JPG">[Screen Shot]</a></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  Search the folders that your buddies have shared. If your buddies are using 
  Google desktop, Symbee uses Google desktop to provide the search results.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Photo Preview and Sharing</u> </font>
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">
  <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/thumb_nail_sshot.JPG">[Screen 
  Shot]</a></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  View image previews before you download them. Browse and preview all the 
  photos and choose what to download and what to skip.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Download Directories/Multiple Files</u> </font>
  <font face="Verdana" size="1">
  <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://symbeeonline.com/images/directory_download_sshot.JPG">[Screen Shot]</a></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
  You can select multiple files or whole directories to be copied</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Allow or Block buddies selectively</u><br>
  You can setup Symbee to allow only specific buddies to access you shared 
  folders or block specific buddies.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u>Allow or block sharing specific file 
  types</u><br>
  You can setup Symbee to allow only specific files types like music files or 
  photos or block specific file types like word documents.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are still working on website, but a basic 
one is running on: <a href="http://symbeeonline.com/">http://symbeeonline.com/</a>. 
If you are concerned about Security take a look at the notes on Security and FAQs. 
You may not be able to really use the app unless you have your Google talk buddies using 
it, 
so feel free to forward the download link below to your buddies. We are not 
giving any download link from the website yet as it is still in beta.</font></p>

<p><u><font face="Verdana" size="2">How do I install and use Symbee</font></u></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You need Java 1.6 on your machine to run 
Symbee. Most of the users already have Java running on their machine due to the 
auto-update features. </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Internet Explorer users, just click 
  <a href="http://symbeeonline.com/install.html">here</a>, It will install Java if needed and launch symbee. An 
  icon on the Desktop 
  and Program Files will be created.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For other browsers, you will have to 
  manually install Java 1.6. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You can find a suitable version of Java 
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">here</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - After you have installed Java, click 
  <a href="http://symbeeonline.com/install.html">here</a> to 
  install symbee</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Apple users - I don't know what went 
  wrong, but they yanked the 1.6 version from the Apple's  site. However there 
  is still one available here:&nbsp;

</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Feel free to write to me for any help in using 
it or questions at <a href="mailto:sachin.shetty@gmail.com">sachin.shetty@gmail.com</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Any help in testing, stabilizing, publicizing 
Symbee will be great, hope to hear back from you guys!</font></p>
